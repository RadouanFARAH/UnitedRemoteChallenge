## HOW TO RUN IT
1- Download the repository or clone it to a folder in your computer

2- Run the shell/terminal on that folder 

3- run this commande "npm install" and wait till it ends

4- run this commande to run it "npm start"

It will automatically open in your default browser :) 


### choice of libraries

I used axios to get the data from the gitHub API because axios performs automatic transforms of JSON data.

I used uuid to give a unique identifier to each repo, because there is a chance that multiple components may independently generate a non-unique identifier.
